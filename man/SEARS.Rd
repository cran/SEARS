\title{
A randomized distributed phase I-II seamless dose escalation/expansion schema for dose optimization and selection in early oncology clinical development
}
\description{
Implements seamless randomized phase I-II SEARS design for finding the optimal design. Practitioners can use a rich set of parameters to explore various real scenarios for their studies. The function can generate operating characteristics via simulation for practitioners to examine the designâ€™s properties
